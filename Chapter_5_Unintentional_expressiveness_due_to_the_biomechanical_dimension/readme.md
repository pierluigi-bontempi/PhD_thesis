# An innovative computer-based model for the generation of expressive lead guitar performances (PhD Thesis) 

## Description 

The materials in this folder pertain to Chapter 5 of the PhD thesis, titled "Unintentional expressiveness due to the biomechanical dimension: a Machine Learning-based modelling approach." 

The Jupyter notebook 1-From_MIDI_to_CSV.ipynb is dedicated to generating a .csv file by parsing an input MIDI file. 
The Jupyter notebook 2-Descriptive_statistics_and_prediction_models.ipynb is focused on descriptive statistics for the dataset and building predictive models. 

The MIDI files were generated from audio recordings, as detailed in the thesis. 

This folder also includes the generated .csv files from the MIDI files, complete with data on fingering and articulation/expressive techniques.
