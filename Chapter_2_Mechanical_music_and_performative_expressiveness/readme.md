# An innovative computer-based model for the generation of expressive lead guitar performances (PhD Thesis, by Pierluigi Bontempi (Centro di Sonologia Computazionale, Department of Information Engineering, University of Padua) 

## Description 

The materials in this folder pertain to Chapter 2 of the PhD thesis, titled "Mechanical music and performative expressiveness." 

A brief description of the materials is listed below:

- DB-Scan_batch_solution.ipynb
This notebook relates to the batch implementation of the automatic expressive areas search system based on the recursive use of the unsupervised DBSCAN clustering algorithm.

- MIDI_dataset
This folder contains some example MIDI Files, generated from scans of rolls for player piano.

- The ‘Single version software’ and ‘Batch version software’ folders contain the Python files relating to the final software implementation, in single file and bulk versions, described in detail in the scientific paper available at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1296207424000852. In both cases, the main.py file must be started.
