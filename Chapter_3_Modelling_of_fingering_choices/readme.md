# An innovative computer-based model for the generation of expressive lead guitar performances (PhD Thesis, by Pierluigi Bontempi (Centro di Sonologia Computazionale, Department of Information Engineering, University of Padua)

## Description 

The materials in this folder pertain to Chapter 3 of the PhD thesis, titled "Modelling of fingering choices." 

The Jupyter notebook From_MIDI_to_DF_and_CPLEX.ipynb is dedicated to generating a .csv file by parsing an input MIDI file. It also prints the data required for the subsequent use of CPLEX to generate the optimal fingering. 
The CPLEX folder contains the model (.mod), an example of input data (.dat) and side files for the use of the model in CPLEX  (IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio is required).
